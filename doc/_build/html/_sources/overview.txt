Overview
========

ConCoord is a novel coordination service that provides replication and
synchronization support for large-scale distributed systems. ConCoord
employs an object-oriented approach, in which the system actively
creates and maintains live replicas for user-provided objects. Through
ConCoord, the clients are able to access these replicated objects
transparently as if they are local objects. ConCoord uses these
replicated objects to implement coordination and synchronization
constructs in large-scale distributed systems, in effect establishing
a transparent way of providing a coordination service.
